# python-challenge

**#PyBank**
Here's a brief explanation of what each section of the code does:

Importing Libraries: The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including pandas and pathlib.

Loading Data: It loads the budget data from the "budget.csv" file into a pandas DataFrame.

Calculating Metrics:

total_months: Calculates the total number of months in the dataset.
total_amt: Calculates the net total amount of "Profit/Losses."
average_change_df: Calculates the average change in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
greatest_increase_date and greatest_increase_amount: Finds the date and amount of the greatest increase in profits.
greatest_decrease_date and greatest_decrease_amount: Finds the date and amount of the greatest decrease in profits.
Writing Results to a Text File: The code writes the calculated results to a text file named "financial_analysis.txt."

Printing a Confirmation Message: Finally, the code prints a message confirming that the analysis results have been saved to "financial_analysis.txt."

**#PyPoll**

Here's a brief explanation of what each section of the code does:

Importing Libraries: The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including pandas and pathlib.

Loading Data: It loads the election data from the "election_data.csv" file into a pandas DataFrame.

Calculating Metrics:

Total_votes: Calculates the total number of votes in the dataset.
candidate_list: Creates a list of unique candidates.
votes: Counts the number of votes each candidate received.
Percentage: Calculates the percentage of votes each candidate received.
winner: Determines the winner based on the candidate with the most votes.
Writing Results to a Text File: The code writes the calculated results to a text file named "voting_analysis.txt."

Printing a Confirmation Message: Finally, the code prints a message confirming that the analysis results have been saved to "voting_analysis.txt."
